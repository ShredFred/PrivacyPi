I used a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)\r\n* 8GB MicroSD memory card\r\n* Micro USB cable\r\n* USB charger capable of [powering the Pi](https://google.com/)\r\n* Ethernet cable\r\n* A housing to keep your Pi safe and secure after installation. I went with [this](https://google.com/).\r\n\r\nAlong with these extras for getting set up:\r\n* Monitor with HDMI input\r\n* HDMI cable\r\n* USB keyboard\r\n* USB mouse\r\n\r\n###Install Raspbian using NOOBS\r\n\r\nNOOBS stands for **New Out Of the Box Software** and is the installer and recovery platform that we'll use to install Raspbian on our Pi.\r\n\r\nFollow the [NOOBS Setup Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) and you'll end up on the desktop of a fresh installation of Raspbian and ready to continue building your PrivacyPi.\r\n\r\n###Change some settings\r\n\r\nOnce you're on the Raspbian desktop head over to the settings and update these settings:\r\n\r\n* Change your devices name to PrivacyPi\r\n* Change your password to something other than the default ```raspberry```\r\n* Update your date, time, and location\r\n* Set your language and keyboard layout\r\n* Set the Pi to automatically login with the ```pi``` user on startup\r\n* Set your Pi to start in the command line interface (CLI), this will free up resources when you no longer need the desktop. The command to manually load the desktop whenever you need to is ```startx```\r\n\r\nFor some added local security you could go ahead and change the password for the ```pi``` user to something other than the default ```raspberry```. This could be helpful if you regularly have people poking around on your local network.\r\n\r\n###Configure your local network\r\n\r\nIt's important that your Pi is always assigned the same IP address by your router (DHCP Server). The good news is that most routers these days make it easy for you to manually reserve an IP address for your device. \r\n\r\nLogin to your router's management interface and reserver an IP address for your Pi that matches your existing network, usually this will look like ```192.168.0.x``` or ```192.168.1.x```. Refer to your routers documentation for specific instructions but usually you'll need to find the table showing all the connected devices (DHCP Table) and choosing a device to reserve an address for. You'll recall we renamed the Pi to ```PrivacyPi``` so it should be easy to identify from the table.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the tutorial we're going to assume you've assigned the IP address ```192.168.1.251``` to your Pi which has the hostname ```PirvacyPi```.\r\n\r\nRestart your Pi. It should load to the CLI. \r\n\r\nOnce at the CLI you can confirm that you've been assigned the correct IP address by typing the command:\r\n\r\n\tifconfig -a\r\n\r\nHopefully you should see an output that starts with something like:\r\n\r\n\teth0 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  \r\n    inet addr:192.168.1.251  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\r\n    inet6 addr: fe80::ba27:ebff:fe54:bee5/64 Scope:Link\r\n    UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\r\n    RX packets:607649 errors:0 dropped:1097 overruns:0 frame:0\r\n    TX packets:492564 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\r\n    collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000    \r\n    \r\n##Install PrivacyPi Bundle\r\n\r\nThis step could technically be completed using the Pi's CLI but for a lot of users it will be easier to load up the desktop by typing ```startx```.\r\n\r\n1. Open the Pi's web browser and head to [privacypi.io](http://privacypi.io/) and download the [latest PrivacyPi zip archive](https://github.com/jonathanhaslett/PrivacyPi/zipball/master).\r\n2. Extract the files from the zip archive.\r\n3. Opens the Pi's file manager program and move all the files you just extracted to your home directory, if you're still using the default \"pi\" user then you're home directory will be located at ```/home/pi/```.\r\n4. Open the Pi's terminal client. It should automatically place you in your home directory, shown as ```~```. If you enter the command ```ls``` it should show a listing of the home directory folders along with the files you just moved during the previous step.\r\n5. Run the PrivacyPi install script by typing the command ```sh install```. The script will use ```apt-get``` to install the software needed and make a few changes so that you're ready to move on to the next steps below.\r\n\r\n##OpenVPN - VPN Client\r\n\r\nUsing the Pi's web browser, download the OpenVPN configuration files from your VPN provider's website. The file with either be a single ```*.conf``` file or an archive containing multiple files such as a ```*.conf``` files and some certificate files.\r\n\r\nEdit the main .conf file with the Pi's text editor and add these two lines t the bottom of the file:\r\n\r\n\tscript-security 2\r\n\tup /home/pi/vpn-up\r\n\tdown /home/pi/vpn-down\r\n\t\r\nThese commands will automatically start and stop the proxy servers when the VPN starts or stops. This prevents a problem that Gavin [described](http://www.privacypi.org/making-things-a-little-more-private/) where you'll run into problem if a proxy server tries to start using the VPN's ```tun0``` network interface before it exists.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to move the files but you'll need Super User privileges to write to ```/etc/openvpn/``` so close the file manager and then launch it from the terminal with SU privileges by typing ```sudo pcmanfm```.\r\n\r\nMove all the files provided by your VPN provider to the ```/etc/openvpn/```` directory. When OpenVPN start's it will search this folder for a *.conf file and use those details to connect to your VPN.\r\n\r\n##How to start OpenVPN Automatically When the RPi Starts\r\n\r\nNow that the OpenVPN server is installed, it is time to make it run as a service every time the Pi boots up.\r\n\r\nEdit the file ```/etc/default/openvpn``` with:\r\n\r\n\tsudo pico /etc/default/openvpn\r\n\r\nUncomment the line ```#AUTOSTART=\"all\"``` and either leave it as all, or replace it with the name of the specific server ```*.conf``` file you'd like to automatically connect.\r\n\r\nThat's it, OpenVPN should be ready to go unless there's a problem with with your provided config. We'll get around to testing everything in a minute.\r\n\r\n##Privoxy - HTTP/HTTPS Proxy\r\n\r\n*Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk.* - [privoxy.org](http://www.privoxy.org/)\r\n\r\nOnly minor changes are required for privoxy.\r\n\r\nOpen the config file by typing:\r\n\r\n\tsudo pico /etc/privoxy/config\r\n\t\r\nSearch for the variable named ```listen-address``` and change it's value to your Pi's IP address, for example I'm using ```192.168.1.251```.\r\n\r\n##Dante - SOCKS5 Proxy\r\n\r\nDante is a [SOCKS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) that we'll use to route non-web traffic through the VPN connection. \r\n\r\nThe ```sh install``` script has done most the heavy lifting here. we've replaced Dante's config file that tells Dante to accept incoming connections on port ```1080``` and route traffic through the VPN connection labeled ```tun0```.\r\n\r\nIf, in the future you want to make further config changes, you can view and edit the Dante config file by typing:\r\n\r\n\tsudo pico /etc/danted.conf\r\n\r\n##Testing your new software.\r\n\r\nIf you extracted all the files to your ```/home/pi``` home directory you'll be able to type these commands to control the software we've just installed:\r\n\r\n```sh ~/start``` - start OpenVPN, and thanks to your config file changes start Privoxy/Dante once the VPN is connected.\r\n\r\n```sh ~/stop``` - stop OpenVPN, and thanks to your config file changes stop Privoxy/Dante as well.\r\n\r\n```sh ~/status``` - output the status for the VPN connection (tun0) and well as the status of the services OpenVPN, Privoxy, and Dante.\r\n\r\nWhen OpenVPN has connected and Privoxy+Dante have successfully started, the ```sh ~/status``` command should output something similar to this:\r\n\r\n\ttun0      Link encap:UNSPEC  HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  \r\n          inet addr:XX.XXX.X.XX  P-t-P:XXX.XXX.X.XX  Mask:255.255.0.0\r\n          inet6 addr: fdad:bdef:735d:72::101d/112 Scope:Global\r\n          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\r\n          RX packets:856098 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\r\n          TX packets:612917 errors:0 dropped:7655 overruns:0 carrier:0\r\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 \r\n          RX bytes:1131753021 (1.0 GiB)  TX bytes:42825235 (40.8 MiB)\r\n\r\n\topenvpn.service - OpenVPN service\r\n\t\tLoaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/openvpn.service; enabled)\r\n\t\tActive: active (exited) since Mon 2015-10-19 22:39:46 ACST; 1 weeks 0 days ago\r\n\t\tProcess: 5771 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\r\n\t\tMain PID: 5771 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\r\n\t\tCGroup: /system.slice/openvpn.service\r\n\t\t\r\n\tprivoxy.service - Privacy enhancing HTTP Proxy\r\n  \t\tLoaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/privoxy.service; disabled)\r\n\t\tActive: active (running) since Mon 2015-10-19 22:40:00 ACST; 1 weeks 0 days ago\r\n\t\tProcess: 5724 ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -f $PIDFILE (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\r\n\t\tProcess: 5910 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/privoxy --pidfile $PIDFILE --user $OWNER $CONFIGFILE (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\r\n\t\tMain PID: 5911 (privoxy)\r\n\t\tCGroup: /system.slice/privoxy.service\r\n           └─5911 /usr/sbin/privoxy --pidfile /var/run/privoxy.pid --user pri...\r\n\r\n\tdanted.service - LSB: SOCKS (v4 and v5) proxy daemon (danted)\r\n\t\tLoaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/danted)\r\n\t\tActive: active (running) since Mon 2015-10-19 22:39:59 ACST; 1 weeks 0 days ago\r\n\t\tProcess: 5868 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/danted start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\r\n\t\tCGroup: /system.slice/danted.service\r\n           ├─5874 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           ├─5875 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           ├─5876 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           ├─5877 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           ├─5878 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           ├─5879 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n           └─5881 /usr/sbin/danted -D\r\n\r\n\t\r\nIf it looks like your VPN ```tun0``` is connected and Privoxy+Dante are running you should be ready to open up your PC's browser/torrent software and enter the proxy settings.\r\n\r\nFor a HTTP/HTTPS proxy you'll need to enter the Pi's IP Address plus port ```8118```.\r\n\r\nFor a SOCKS5 proxy you'll need to enter the Pi's IP Address plus port ```1080```.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up the proxy in your web browser, test that it's working by visiting the website https://ipleak.net/ to confirm that your network traffic is being routed through the VPN.\r\n\r\nIf everything is up and running as expected it's time to reboot your Pi and disconnect the keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Wait a few minutes for the system to restart and then test your proxied web browser again.\r\n\r\nFrom now on you'll be able to connect to the Pi over your network using a SSH with the ```pi``` username and with the default ```raspberry``` password or the password that you've set.\r\n\r\nIf you run into any problems or have suggestions for improvements, head over the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jonathanhaslett/PrivacyPi/issues.\r\n\r\n##Future Ideas:\r\n* Install Script Upgrade\r\n\t* Uninstall software/services that aren't needed to free up more system resources\r\n\t* ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
