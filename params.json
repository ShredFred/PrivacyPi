I used a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)\r\n* 8GB MicroSD memory card\r\n* Micro USB cable\r\n* USB charger capable of [powering the Pi](https://google.com/)\r\n* Ethernet cable\r\n* A housing to keep your Pi safe and secure after installation. I went with [this](https://google.com/).\r\n\r\nAlong with these extras for getting set up:\r\n* Monitor with HDMI input\r\n* HDMI cable\r\n* USB keyboard\r\n* USB mouse\r\n\r\n###Install Raspbian using NOOBS\r\n\r\nNOOBS stands for **New Out Of the Box Software** and is the installer and recovery platform that we'll use to install Raspbian on our Pi.\r\n\r\nFollow the [NOOBS Setup Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) and you'll end up on the desktop of a fresh installation of Raspbian and ready to continue building your PrivacyPi.\r\n\r\n###Change some settings\r\n\r\n* Device Name - Change to PrivacyPi\r\n* Localisation - Set your time, date, and keyboard layout, useful when working with config files later on\r\n* Start in cli - use startx to launch gui\r\n* \r\n\r\n###Configure your local network\r\n\r\nIt's important that your Pi is always assigned the same IP address by your router (DHCP Server). The good news is that most routers these days make it easy for you to manually reserve an IP address for your device. \r\n\r\nLogin to your router's management interface and reserver an IP address for your Pi that matches your existing network, usually this will look like ```192.168.0.x``` or ```192.168.1.x```. Refer to your routers documentation for specific instructions but usually you'll need to find the table showing all the connected devices (DHCP Table) and choosing a device to reserve an address for. You'll recall we renamed the Pi to ```PrivacyPi``` so it should be easy to identify from the table.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the tutorial we're going to assume you've assigned the IP address ```192.168.1.251``` to your Pi which has the hostname ```PirvacyPi```.\r\n\r\nRestart your Pi. It should load to the command line interface *(CLI)*. \r\n\r\nOnce at the CLI you can confirm that you've been assigned the correct IP address by typing the command:\r\n\r\n\tifconfig -a\r\n\r\nHopefully you should see an output that looks like:\r\n\r\n\teth0 sdjfkjsakdjfhkjsadhfkjhajksdhf'\r\n\tsdfgfdgsdfg\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##OpenVPN - VPN Client\r\n\r\n##Privoxy - HTTP/HTTPS Proxy\r\n\r\n##Dante - SOCKS5 Proxy\r\n\r\n##Customise the startup order\r\n\r\n##Testing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
