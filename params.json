I used a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)\r\n* 8GB MicroSD memory card\r\n* Micro USB cable\r\n* USB charger capable of [powering the Pi](https://google.com/)\r\n* Ethernet cable\r\n* A housing to keep your Pi safe and secure after installation. I went with [this](https://google.com/).\r\n\r\nAlong with these extras for getting set up:\r\n* Monitor with HDMI input\r\n* HDMI cable\r\n* USB keyboard\r\n* USB mouse\r\n\r\n###Install Raspbian using NOOBS\r\n\r\nNOOBS stands for **New Out Of the Box Software** and is the installer and recovery platform that we'll use to install Raspbian on our Pi.\r\n\r\nFollow the [NOOBS Setup Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) and you'll end up on the desktop of a fresh installation of Raspbian and ready to continue building your PrivacyPi.\r\n\r\n###Change some settings\r\n\r\n* Device Name - Change to PrivacyPi\r\n* Localisation - Set your time, date, and keyboard layout, useful when working with config files later on\r\n* Start in cli - use startx to launch gui\r\n* \r\n\r\n###Configure your local network\r\n\r\nIt's important that your PrivacyPi always\r\n\r\n##OpenVPN - VPN Client\r\n\r\n##Privoxy - HTTP/HTTPS Proxy\r\n\r\n##Dante - SOCKS5 Proxy\r\n\r\n##Customise the startup order\r\n\r\n##Testing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
