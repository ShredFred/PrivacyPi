I used a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)\r\n* 8GB MicroSD memory card\r\n* Micro USB cable\r\n* USB charger capable of [powering the Pi](https://google.com/)\r\n* Ethernet cable\r\n* A housing to keep your Pi safe and secure after installation. I went with [this](https://google.com/).\r\n\r\nAlong with these extras for getting set up:\r\n* Monitor with HDMI input\r\n* HDMI cable\r\n* USB keyboard\r\n* USB mouse\r\n\r\n###Install Raspbian using NOOBS\r\n\r\nNOOBS stands for **New Out Of the Box Software** and is the installer and recovery platform that we'll use to install Raspbian on our Pi.\r\n\r\nFollow the [NOOBS Setup Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) and you'll end up on the desktop of a fresh installation of Raspbian and ready to continue building your PrivacyPi.\r\n\r\n###Change some settings\r\n\r\n* Device Name - Change to PrivacyPi\r\n* Localisation - Set your time, date, and keyboard layout, useful when working with config files later on\r\n* Start in cli - use startx to launch gui\r\n* \r\n\r\n###Configure your local network\r\n\r\nIt's important that your Pi is always assigned the same IP address by your router (DHCP Server). The good news is that most routers these days make it easy for you to manually reserve an IP address for your device. \r\n\r\nLogin to your router's management interface and reserver an IP address for your Pi that matches your existing network, usually this will look like ```192.168.0.x``` or ```192.168.1.x```. Refer to your routers documentation for specific instructions but usually you'll need to find the table showing all the connected devices (DHCP Table) and choosing a device to reserve an address for. You'll recall we renamed the Pi to ```PrivacyPi``` so it should be easy to identify from the table.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the tutorial we're going to assume you've assigned the IP address ```192.168.1.251``` to your Pi which has the hostname ```PirvacyPi```.\r\n\r\nRestart your Pi. It should load to the command line interface *(CLI)*. \r\n\r\nOnce at the CLI you can confirm that you've been assigned the correct IP address by typing the command:\r\n\r\n\tifconfig -a\r\n\r\nHopefully you should see an output that starts with something like:\r\n\r\n\teth0 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  \r\n    inet addr:192.168.1.251  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\r\n    inet6 addr: fe80::ba27:ebff:fe54:bee5/64 Scope:Link\r\n    UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\r\n    RX packets:607649 errors:0 dropped:1097 overruns:0 frame:0\r\n    TX packets:492564 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\r\n    collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000     \r\n    \r\n##Install PrivacyPi Bundle\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jonathanhaslett/PrivacyPi/zipball/master\r\n\r\n##OpenVPN - VPN Client\r\n\r\n##Privoxy - HTTP/HTTPS Proxy\r\n\r\n*Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk.* - [privoxy.org](http://www.privoxy.org/)\r\n\r\nOnly minor changes are required for privoxy.\r\n\r\nOpen the config file by typing:\r\n\r\n\tsudo pico /etc/privoxy/config\r\n\t\r\nSearch for the variable named ```listen-address``` and change it's value to your Pi's IP address, we're using ```192.168.1.251```.\r\n\r\n##Dante - SOCKS5 Proxy\r\n\r\nDante is a [SOCKS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) that we'll use to route non-web traffic through the VPN connection. \r\n\r\nThe ```sh install``` script has done most the heavy lifting here. we've replaced Dante's config file that tells Dante to accept incoming connections on port ```1080``` and route traffic through the VPN connection labeled ```tun0```.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make further config changes, you can view and edit the Dante config file by typing:\r\n\r\n\tsudo pico /etc/danted.conf\r\n\r\n##Some basic shell scripts to make life easier\r\n\r\nIf you extracted all the files to your /home/pi home directory you'll be able to type these commands to control your PrivacyPi:\r\n\r\n```sh ~/start``` - start OpenVPN, and thanks to your config file changes start Privoxy/Dante once the VPN is connected.\r\n\r\n```sh ~/stop``` - stop OpenVPN, and thanks to your config file changes stop Privoxy/Dante as well.\r\n\r\n```sh ~/status``` - output the status for the VPN connection (tun0) and well as the status of the services OpenVPN, Privoxy, and Dante.\r\n\r\n##Testing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
